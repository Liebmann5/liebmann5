### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
You might be wondering how you ended up here? 

Some fun things about the man inside the van:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working construction because having a BS in Applied Math and then spending 4+ years teaching youyself Software Engingeering by reading 18 textbooks is not good enough to work anywhere outside of construction.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently researching the phenomenom of "professional experience" and the bizarre minds using the term.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my very advanced knowdledge of Super Hydrogen Colliders.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Liebmann.nicholas1@gmail.com or Liebmann5 literally everywhere.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Tony Hawk has skated right past me.
