### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
You might be wondering how you ended up here? 

Some fun things GitHub auto provided for me making me this README(yell this word)
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on many many prestigous and scientific and noble things that will change the world but shant bore you with all of my highly respected achievements.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to write with both hands at the same time; maximizing efficiency.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing. I'm like Rudolph but with no red-nose.  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Super Hydrogen Colliders.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my very advanced knowdledge of Super Hydrogen Colliders.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Get in contact with Mr. Anderson... he will ensure we communicate via mouths.
- ðŸ˜„ Todays Task: Research particle neurons related to atmospheric anomalies. Very very busy. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Just found out people stop then go then park and then go again at Drive-Thrus. I always thought it was just a fun narrow challenge-like road to drive on.
